1. finish excel sheet
2. Event tracer.
3. image build
4. code review
5. Catch all COPP.
  a. what happens if we have user defined copp.
  b. will the policing be reset what was before.
  c. if we move the reason code to presel what is the maximum number of presel ids that can be mapped to a group
6. User defained COPP. -- Need clarity
  a. Where do we stand for the Class ID fix.
    i. in the future we want to avoid having multiple entries in the presel group.
  b. why not use EFP.  Mon Dec 27 2021
    i. Do we support all the QSET and ASET in EFP.
    ii. how do we map CPU bound traffic in COSQ.
    iii. Old to new qset mapping
    iv.
7. Have to read the bcm case updates shivaram has provided.
8. verify gport match against CPU.
9. Go over the fp rules to check if all actions have been considered.
  a. there are some drop cancel rules, need to understand those.
10. look at flex counters code.
11. old new aset, qset mapping.
12. The QSET event bit size using hint.

Cint Verification:
1. multiple hints.
2. size of the field based on the interested reason codes.
3. turn off all copy to cpu reason codes except for bcmPktTraceEventIngressIfpMeter
      a. make sure that only the policed green packet is punted to CPU.
      b. if there is no match then no copy to CPU.
      c. if we turn bcmPktTraceEventIngressIfpMeter also off then even if there is a match or not no copy to CPU.
      d. Have the 4 reason code + dst gport in presel and have FE configured.
        - Send traffic and verify if one of the 5 presel matches + main TCAM match, traffic policed.
        - If no match in presel then packet should be dropped.
        - Match is presel but no match in main tcam packet should be dropped.
4. turn off all copy to cpu reason codes except for bcmPktTraceEventIngressIfp
      a. make sure that only the policed green packet is punted to CPU.
      b. if there is no match then no copy to CPU.
      c. if we turn bcmPktTraceEventIngressIfpMeter also off then even if there is a match or not no copy to CPU.
      d. Have the 4 reason code + dst gport in presel and have FE configured.
        - Send traffic and verify if one of the 5 presel matches + main TCAM match, traffic policed.
        - If no match in presel then packet should be dropped.
        - Match is presel but no match in main tcam packet should be dropped.
5. Do we need both bcmPktTraceEventIngressIfp and bcmPktTraceEventIngressIfpMeter to be enabled.
