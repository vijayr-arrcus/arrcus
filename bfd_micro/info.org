Information from Prasanna:

a. When peer BFD is removed without min links what happens.
    Does LACP get reset, stopped or what happens.
b. Need to look into packet capture.
c. with peer BFD admin down how does min links work.\
d. how does min links with static bond work ?
e. How do valuate whats the impact of resetting LACP.
    * LACP goes down and would take 3 seconds to declare down again.
    * but that member was egress disabled before and removed from trunk as well.


BFD not configured on Peer:

Cisco side BFD configured with Arrcus side BFD not configured.
   state is unknown.
Configured min links Bundle remains UP.


BFD configured on PEER:
   we configure BFD on Cisco device first and before we configured BFD on Arrcus device the state shows its down.
   Cisco device is configured with min links
   BOth BFD sessions came up.
   Bundle on Cisco was UP.
   did a no of bfd micro on Arrcus
   on Cisco device bundle is down
   BFD shows down instead of ADMIN DOWN. -- bug RFC calls this out.
   But the physical member link LACP shows MUX as distributing -- not sure if this means anything.
   we tried removing min links - Bond interface dint come up on Arrcus.
   Removed BFD on Cisco device, bond interface came up.

   Remove bfd on both device
   configure BFD on Cisco device without min links.
   configure BFD on Arrcus device.
   check BFD state on both sides.  UP and interface is up on both sides.
    remove bfd on arrcus device.  BFD went down in cisco device and bond interface went down in Cisco device.
    added BFD configs on arrcus device and Bundle came up.
    default min-links is 1 ?
        Verified min-links is 1, we configured static bond on Arrcus side without min links on Cisco device with LACP and bond went down.

    LACP is UP, BFD is down, bond interface is down -- Cisco.
    Only way to get interface up again is to configure bfd on peer or remove bfd on local.
    So min links of BFD is managed differently then min links of LACP.  --- This is critical
        - How important is it that we adhere to Cisco behavior.
        - if this is a make or break then we have to go with

    Configure static bond on both interface.
    strange LACP or static is member link property on Cisco device. -- not relevant here...
    without lacp both the bonds came up.
    Configure BFD on Cisco device.
    session state was unknown
    Bundle interface was up on Cisco device.
    confgiured BFD on arrcus
    sessions came up.
    did a no of micro bfd on arrcus
    session is detected a down in cisco
    Bundle is brought down -- min links - 1
        - So bfd is down, link is up and
    Not sure if we send ADMIN down when we do no bfd micro ?
    How do we check what the hardware sends when we delete the BFD session.
    But that apart
    
    If ip address is removed on the peer -- BFD goes down and brings bundle down on the local device in Cisco.
