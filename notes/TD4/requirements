a. End of august, EFT image for qualification.
   TD3 features parity. -- X3, X5, X7
     OpenMLAG.
        bond.
     VXLAN.
     Type1 to type5 routing.
     Centralized routing using EVPN.
     breakout. -- more information required on the breakout configs.

     Topology:
          VXLAN -- QA Topology.
          3 router topology with breakout support.


No MPLS, NO sr, No l3vpn , no BGP pic,

10x4, 25x4, 50x2(ignore) -- TD3 breakout support.
    with gear box -- 128x100 or 32x400.

    100x4 makes more sense.
    200x2 check ?
    50x8 ?

    Check the cables and usecase requirements.

topology


BFD - desired 150ms, required 150ms, multiplier 3
MMU - buffer allocation per queue, per queue discard thresholds, Buffer usage stats,
BOND - LACP mode only
BGP - Control plane
BGP Best path selection - Control plane
ISIS - Control plane (any multicast mac registration ?)
OSPV2 v4/v6 - Control plane (any multicast mac registration ?)
OSPV3 v4/v6 - Control plane (any multicast mac registration ?)
LLDP - Control plane (any multicast mac registration ?)
static routing
Layer-2 network instance
STP
storm control
Bridge Isolation
ACL
QOS
COPP
SFLOW
DHCP - Control plane (any multicast mac registration ?)
Telemetry - DPAL stats
SNMP - Control plane
Event manager - control plane
L3 VRF
EVPN -- scale profiles,
VLAN -- scale profiles,
VRRP -- Control plane only ?
ICMP tunneling
gRPC and gNMI - Control plane only
Breakout ports - we have received 32x400G switches.
               - Question is it being planned to be positioned in the spine or in the leaf ?
               - 400G ports make sense for spine
               - 4x100 sounds fine for leaf
               - do we really need the other modes - 10/25/40/50 ?
