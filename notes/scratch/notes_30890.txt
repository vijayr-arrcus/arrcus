1. nw  port, normal ingress sflow sampling for untagged traffic, we see vlan0, prefer no vlan.




1. acc port, normal ingress sflow smapling for untagged traffic, we see reserved vlan, ask is for no vlan.
2. acc port, flex egress sflow ampling for untagged traffic, we see vlan0, ask is for no vlan for traffic for traffic coming from network to access. --- Lavanya to repro internally to make sure if this indeed the behavior.
3. acc port, flex egress sflow ampling for untagged traffic, we see reserved vlan, ask is for no vlan for traffic for traffic coming from access to access.

1. vlan0, is wrong -- reserved vlan.
