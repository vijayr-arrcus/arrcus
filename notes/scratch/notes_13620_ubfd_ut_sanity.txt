Static Bond - 3 member links.
1. Bring up member links one by one, all BFD session should work across all session.
2. destroy end point on the peer and check bfd sessions gets delete locally.
3. destroy end point on the peer and check if ingress traffic is being received and forwarded.
4. configure min links - 2 and remove one member link from the bond on the peer. Bond should go down locally.
forwarding check
5. have traffic hashing onto all 3 member links, destroy end point on the peer and traffic should stop hashing locally.
6. have traffic hashing onto all 3 member links, remove one member link from bond traffic on the peer and traffic should stop hashing onto the member link locally.
   add back the remote member link and traffic should start rehashing into the member link.
7. Check if egress disabled works for control plane traffic as well, that is any bond traffic in control plane should not be hashed onto to the BFD down member link on the linux side.

LACP Bond - 3 member links.
1. Need to simulate only LACP going down... have some kernel iptables to drop LACP packets on one member link.
  that should trigger LACP member link to go out sync and cause BFD to tear down.
2. Bring back LACP and BFD should converge..
3. Repeat all 7 test above with LACP enabled.

have both v4 and v6 sessions in the above test cases.

v4 and v6
1. have both v4 and v6, remove v4 address and check if min-links kicks in and brings down bond interface.
2. have both v4 and v6, remove v6 address and check if min-links kicks in and brings down bond interface.
