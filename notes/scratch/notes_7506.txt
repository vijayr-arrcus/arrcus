1. by default the policer rate configured is 0 -- policer rate for a particular BUM traffic type, I checked for Broadcast.
   I am assuming that 0 here indicates that its disabled.
   I see the DISABLE rate macro defined in sdk as #define BCM_RATE_DISABLE         0
2. BCM API accepts 0 as input rate and this is valid, and as indicated above means we are diabling storm control/rate limiting.
3. BCM api accepts a large kbps value however when I get the value set, kbps and burst values are 0,
   the API doesnt return an error however accepts some degree greater than port bandwidth. However for very large values the rates are set to 0 indicating storm control is diabled.
4. Now looking at SDK code how large a value is acceptable.
5. If its disarable to enforce rate limit value to 0, indicating absolutely drop all BUM traffic I can check with BCM support on how to achieve this.
