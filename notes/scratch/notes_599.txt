1. ACL -- replicates for bond and its member links.
2. in dpal for xgs we ignore bond notifications and handle only member link notification.
3. for ACL is_bond check is in xlate layer -- target_id(tgt_ifindex) is in the bond table or not.
4. if its not in the bond table, we conclude that its target_id is not a bond interface and we process to program the ACL.
5. ACL notification and ifmgr notification to DPAL.
6. is_bond actually fails. eventhough its for bond.
7. obj_add --> main_cbk we assume that its ETHERNET_TYPE.
  a. on the port_table for this ifindex.
  b. so once bond object created we call the main_cbk.
8. port object for this ifindex from the port table --> that trunk gport and we add to the port bitmap -- it crashes.


1. to move the is_bond check to main_cbk.
  a. is_bond in main_cbk.
2. for the PI to contain whether the notification is for bond or not its object. Which can be checked by dpal.
  a. to have the validity check in xlate layer.
