working.

1. Bond is create with member link.
2. ACC vp for bond is created, with member link and we walk over the member links to set the class.


What should be the behavior in this scenario.

1. Bond is create with a single member link.
2. ACC VP for bond is created , with the single member link set class.
3. I add a new member link to bond, so cfg member link= 2, who should set the class for this new member link ?
4. update walker is called.



steps to repro...

1. create bond.
2. create vni
3. and add member link to bond.
