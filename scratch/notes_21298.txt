    commented the mcast group add,



allow addition of trunk members and addition trunk member to the vlan and mcast group...
upon deletion of the trunk member from the trunk I ignore removeing from the trunk group as well as from the mcast group.


I removed swp9s1 from trunk in td43

    I see packets egressing on swp8s1 and swp9s1 of td43 on swp9s1 of td43

  reserved vlan -- 3966
  active member list -- swp10s1, swp9s1;

  1. created tagged list(swp10s1, swp9s1) and untagged list (swp10s1,swp9s1)
  2. we create a multicast group and add swp10s1 and swp9s1 to the group.
  3. there is no vlan translation.
