CMIS -- Common Management Interface Specification
Application -- a specific combination of an industry standard host electrical interface and industry standard module media interface
Flat Memory -- single 256 byte memory implementation without paging.
Host interface -- interface between high speed electrical interface between the module and the host system.
Lower Memory -- The 128 bytes addressed by byte addresses 00h through 7fh.
Module -- Pluggable transceivers and active or passive cable assembly terminations that plug into the host receptacle such as, but not limited to those of QSFP-DD, OSFP, COBO, QSFP, and SFP-DD form factors.
Media interface -- a high speed interface between the module and the interconnect medium, such as wires or optical fibres.
Lower Memory -- the 128 bytes addressed by byte addresses 00h through 7fh.
Upper Memory -- the 128 bytes addressed by byte addresses 80h through ffh.
Lane -- A generic term for the elements associated with transport of one of the high speed signals in one of the module interfaces.

Host -- master,
module -- slave

TWI -- two wire serial interface.
Application -- a specific combination of an industry standard host electrical interface and industry standard module media interface
1. A module may support multiple different applications and/or multiple instances of the same application.
