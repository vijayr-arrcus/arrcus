1. Bond working.
2. vlan translation.
3. different vlans in the ingress and egress.
4. ECMP.
5. remove the UL egress object creation and try.
6. egress vlan translation.
7. normal vlan working.
8. VLAN translation working.
9. can the VNIs be the same across multiple VPNs.
10. can the same VNI be used as some dummy VNIs for all VFIs created for l3 forwarding.
11. Working for the punt path with vlan translation.
12. deriving the DVP and hence the vlan from the l3 intf object.
13. Untagged traffic testing.
  a. BCM_VXLAN_VPN_SERVICE_TAGGED, when we create the VP setting this is fine ? for untaggged traffic ?
14. how is the VLAN derived for the OL NH, we have the access vp and VPN but no pointer to the VLAN.
15. vxlan_port_create -- match is BCM_VXLAN_PORT_MATCH_PORT then what is the significance of
    if (gport != BCM_GPORT_INVALID)
        port_t.match_port = gport;

    if (match_vlan != BCM_VLAN_INVALID)
        port_t.match_vlan = match_vlan;
