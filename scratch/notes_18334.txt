1. same numbered GPUs across nodes are part of the same vlan.
  a. use vlans to provide multi tenancy.
2. can the GPUs + interfaces be mapped to different VRF to provide multi tenancy.
3. 8 any cast gateways corresponding to each of the GPU node.
  a. distributed gatway functionality. Each leaf should be able to route across vnis and switch within vnis.
  b. No centralized gateway.
4. nvswitch - can be used to send traffic from one vlan to another internally by using the nvswitch

5. leaf0 connects to GPU0s
  a. Leaf1 connect to GPU1s
6. Need L3 routing for across vni and L2 switching for within vni - with distributed gateway functionaliy.
7. No lag requirement, each GPU per vlan has its own IP address. -- No multi homing.
8. ETS requires a module on the switch and the participation of the network.
9. PFC and ECN is priority, ETS.
