1. 4G from ixia, egress on a bond with 8 member links.
2. 2550 flows.
3. experiment - 1
  a. 1 flow with 4G and 8 member links ?
     no load sharing.
     there is a one flow and it hashes to a member link.
     hash parameters -- ip address.
  b. 2550 flows and 6 member links.
     with each flow having a unique src/dst ip.
    if we have 6 member links and bring up one more, why is load balancing ?
  c. 2 flow with 4G and 1 member link
     and add a new member link.
