1. why no stats requirement for trunk based access vp configuration.
[vijay] the show stats command should be a seperate cli like what we have for network VP.
the stats counters for l2 subinterface will be hidden.

int bond10
aggregation port type trunk vlan 1001,1002 >>> vlan port --> flow port

no way to show stats

int bond10
subinterface 1001
stats enable true
vlan 1001   -----> flow port

stats as part of subinterface 1001

1. can the stats per acc vp be configuration driven, avoid consuming flex counter resources.
    a. collect  stats per subinterface. ---> we prefer this approach
      i. how do we poll all 5000 subinterfaces, should it be demand based.
      ii. should we keep polling the counters periodically or only fetch on demand basis -- this depends on the usage of the counters... check with Adi. ?
    b. have a global configuration to start collecting stats for all subinterfaces.

The total number of l2 subinterface/access vps we need to support per interface and per box. ?

3. should we have seperate state cli for counters irrespective of how the acc vp is configured.
4. Get the configs for trunk access vp configuration.
5. scale of the stats.
  a. 500 subinterface per bond interface.
  b. 10 member links per bond.
  c. 5000 access vp stats.
  d. 500 subinterface per bond interface.
  e. 20 member links per bond.
  f. 10000

  a. 500 subinterface per bond interface.
  b. 10 member links per bond.
  c. 500 access vp stats.
  d. 500 subinterface per bond interface.
  e. 20 member links per bond.
  f. 500 access vp stats.

  int bond10
  subinterface 1001
  end

  int swp10 ---- id -- 10-1001
  ethernet agg bond10
  int swp20 ---- id -- 20-1001
  ethernet agg bond10
  end


  2 access vps.
