In GDB with a C program, you can do `watch *0x40020000` to set a watchpoint on a memory address, but this fails in Rust programs with a mysterious error. With a hint from @sheevink I found the solution: `watch *(0x40020000 as *const u32)`! gdb has a Rust parser!

watch *(uint64_t *) (address)

show can-use-hw-watchpoints

Set the Watchpoint on Memory Address: Once the program is halted at the breakpoint, you can set a watchpoint on a memory address using the watch command.

For example:watch *(int*)0xaddress

Replace 0xaddress with the memory address you want to watch.
You need to cast the address appropriately based on the data type you want to watch (int in this example).

set print repeats 0
